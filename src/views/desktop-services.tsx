	Who needs servers? I bring you <strong>serverless architecture</strong> that scales
	with your app without the overhead. Using services like AWS Lambda and Azure
	Functions, I build backend systems that only run when needed, cutting costs and
	improving performance at the same time. Your app becomes faster, cheaper, and more
	efficient—what’s not to love?
